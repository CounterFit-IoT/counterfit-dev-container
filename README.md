# CounterFit Dev Container

A version of CounterFit that runs in a VS Code dev container. To use this, use this repo as a template to create a new repository, then open that using either [GitHub codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), or using the [Remote Containers extension in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

You can then develop inside this container against CounterFit. It is already installed in the container, so just needs to be run:

```sh
vscode ➜ /workspaces/counterfit-dev-container (main ✗) $ counterfit
CounterFit - virtual IoT hardware running on port 5000
```

You can then develop your virtual IoT application inside this container.
